# Sunset Prediction Project

The aim of the project was to build a machine learning model that employs social media, meteorological, and air quality data to predict how beautiful a sunset will be on any given day in the three biggest cities of the state of California. 

In order to achieve the results I wanted, I decided to build my own dataset by combining various meteorological and air quality data from 2015 and 2016 and collating them by date. Using sunset quality ratings collected from an Instagram API over the course of seven months, I was able to add a binary scale rating system to my dataset, thus allowing me to use various variables to predict the objective beauty of a sunset on any given day. Using various classification models such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, I developed a successful binary machine learning classification algorithm in the R language.
